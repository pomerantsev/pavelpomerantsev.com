    <h2>Work</h2>

    <p>
      I do frontend web development.
      My preferred tech stack is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’d love to call myself a designer as well,
      but that would be too audacious of me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work as an accessibility lead at
      <a href="https://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>,
      helping the company ensure that its products work well for the widest audience,
      regardless of people’s abilities, preferences, and circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      I strongly believe that design is about solving problems for a diverse user base,
      and not about creating visually appealing mockups
      (although the former does not preclude the latter).
      I spend a lot of my time advocating for inclusive design.
    </p>
