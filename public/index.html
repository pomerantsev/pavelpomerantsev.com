      <p>Hi, I’m Pavel.</p>

      <p>
        Professionally, I do frontend web development.
        I currently work as an accessibility lead at Squarespace,
        trying to ensure that the company’s products work well for the widest audience,
        regardless of people’s abilities, preferences, and circumstances.
      </p>

      <h2>Brief History</h2>

      <p>
        I started working as a web developer in 2013, going through a series of small startups,
        usually being the only web frontend engineer in the company.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the startups got acquired by Samsung, where I stayed from 2017 to 2019.
        Then I left for Squarespace.
      </p>

      <h2>Design and Technology</h2>

      <p>
        Web design and web engineering are a continuum rather than two distinct disciplines.
        A great experience can only be born if both the user needs and the web medium itself
        are deeply understood, and if the interface is structurally sound and visually harmonious.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think of myself as an engineer who can tell good design from bad, especially on the Web.
        I appreciate user-centric design, and I often find myself helping designers put user needs
        above their creative ambitions.
      </p>
